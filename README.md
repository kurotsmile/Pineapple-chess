Pineapple Chess – A Tropical Logic Puzzle Adventure!

Test your wits and sharpen your deduction skills in Pineapple Chess, a puzzle game that blends the elegance of logic games with the charm of pineapples!

In this tropical twist on classic deduction puzzles, your goal is to identify the hidden locations of different types of pineapples on a special grid-based board. The board is divided into rows and columns, and each row and column is marked with clues—numbers that indicate how many pineapples of each type are hidden there.

There are two distinct types of pineapples, and each has a unique pattern and behavior. You must study the hints, make careful guesses, and use strategic logic to place each pineapple correctly. One wrong move could throw off your entire solution!

Once you think you've figured out the right placement for a pineapple, click to confirm it. The game will then reveal surrounding cells and provide updated hints based on your move—helping you refine your strategy and move closer to solving the board.

As you advance, the puzzles become more complex, testing your patience and precision. But don't worry—every board is solvable, and every mistake is a chance to learn.

The game ends when you've correctly placed all pineapples on the board, without missing a single one. Win, and you'll be crowned the true Pineapple Mastermind!

Are you ready to solve the mystery of the pineapples?
